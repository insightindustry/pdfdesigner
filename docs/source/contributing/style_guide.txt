Style Guide
*************

.. note::

  As a general rule of thumb, **PDFDesigner** applies :pep:`PEP 8 <8>` styling,
  with some important differences.

.. contents:: Contents:

Basic Conventions
==================

* Do not terminate lines with semicolons.
* Line length should have a maximum of *approximately* 90 characters. If in doubt,
  make a longer line or break the line between clear concepts.
* Each class should be contained in its own file.
* If a file runs longer than 2,000 lines...it should probably be refactored and
  split.
* All imports should occur at the top of the file.
* Where naming conflicts with imports can occur, import a higher level module and
  use it as a namespace. Thus:

  .. code-block:: python

    from reportlab import platypus
    # DO: use platypus.Paragraph to work with the imported Paragraph class

    from reportlab.platypus import Paragraph as PlatypusParagraph
    # DON'T: use PlatypusParagraph to work with the imported Paragraph class

* Do not use single-line conditions:

  .. code-block:: python

    # GOOD
    if x:
      do_something()

    # BAD
    if x: do_something()

* When testing if an object has a value, be sure to use ``if x is None:`` or
  ``if x is not None``. Do **not** confuse this with ``if x:`` and ``if not x:``.
* Use the ``if x:`` construction for testing truthiness, and ``if not x:`` for
  testing falsiness. This is **different** from testing:

    * ``if x is True:``
    * ``if x is False:``
    * ``if x is None:``

* As of right now, because we feel that it negatively impacts readability and is
  less-widely used in the community, we are **not** using type annotations.

Naming Conventions
==================

* ``variable_name`` and not ``variableName`` or ``VariableName``. Should be a
  noun that describes what information is contained in the variable. If a ``bool``,
  preface with ``is_`` or ``has_`` or similar question-word that can be answered
  with a yes-or-no.
* ``function_name`` and not ``function_name`` or ``functionName``. Should be an
  imperative that describes what the function does (e.g. ``get_next_page``).
* ``CONSTANT_NAME`` and not ``constant_name`` or ``ConstantName``.
* ``ClassName`` and not ``class_name`` or ``Class_Name``.

Design Conventions
===================

* Functions at the module level can only be aware of objects either at a higher
  scope or singletons (which effectively have a higher scope).
* Functions and methods can use **one** positional argument (other than ``self``
  or ``cls``) without a default value. Any other arguments must be keyword
  arguments with default value given.

  .. code-block:: python

    def get_next_page(current_page):
      # rest of function...

    def do_some_function(first_arg,
                         second_arg = None,
                         third_arg = True):
      # rest of function ...

* Functions and methods that accept values should start by validating their
  input, throwing exceptions as appropriate.
* When defining a class, define all attributes in ``__init__``.
* When defining a class, start by defining its attributes and methods as private
  using a single-underscore prefix. Then, only once they're implemented, decide
  if they should be public.
* Don't be afraid of the private attribute/public property/public setter pattern:

  .. code-block:: python

    class SomeClass(object):
      def __init__(*args, **kwargs):
        self._private_attribute = None

      @property
      def private_attribute(self):
        # custom logic which  may override the default return

        return self._private_attribute

      @setter.private_attribute
      def private_attribute(self, value):
        # custom logic that creates modified_value

        self._private_attribute = modified_value

* Separate a function or method's final (or default) ``return`` from the rest of
  the code with a blank line (except for single-line functions/methods).

Documentation Conventions
=========================

We are very big believers in documentation (maybe you can tell). To document
**PDFDesigner** we rely on several tools:

`Sphinx`_
----------

`Sphinx`_ is used to organize the library's documentation into this lovely
readable format (which will also be published to `ReadTheDocs`_). This
documentation is written in `reStructuredText`_ files which are stored in
``<project>/docs/source``.

.. info::
  As a general rule of thumb, we try to apply the `ReadTheDocs`_ own
  `Documentation Style Guide`_ to our `RST <reStructuredText>`_ documentation.

.. hint::

  To build the HTML documentation locally:

  #. In a terminal, navigate to ``<project>/docs``.
  #. Execute ``make html``.

  When built locally, the HTML output of the documentation will be available at
  ``./docs/build/index.html``.

Docstrings
-----------
* Docstrings are used to document the actual source code itself. When
  writing docstrings we adhere to the conventions outlined in :pep:`257`.
