**PDFDesigner** applies the principle of `semantic versioning`_. In general
terms, this means:

#. Versions are expressed as ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``.
#. ``MAJOR`` is incremented when incompatible API changes are made.
#. ``MINOR`` is incremented when new functionality is introduced in a
   backwards-compatible manner.
#. ``PATCH`` is incremented when backwards-compatible bug-fixes are introduced.
